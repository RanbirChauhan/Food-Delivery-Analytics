# Food-Delivery-Analytics

This project presents the complete database design and implementation for an online food ordering system tailored for a college campus environment. The system, named "Food Street," is designed to streamline the food ordering process for students, reducing wait times and improving the overall experience.

***

## üìù Problem Statement

At our college's "Food Street," which houses nearly 10 food stalls, students often face long wait times to get their orders, leading to frustration and wasted time. This inefficiency has caused students to lose interest in the on-campus stalls and seek alternatives outside the college.

The objective of this project is to design and build a robust database for an online food ordering platform. This system will allow students to:
* Browse menus from all stalls online.
* Place orders from anywhere on campus.
* Track the status of their orders in real-time.
* Pay online or on delivery.

The database must efficiently manage information about students, stalls, menu items, orders, payments, and deliveries.

## üß¨ Database Design & Schema

The database was designed using an Entity-Relationship (ER) model to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy. The design was subsequently normalized to the Third Normal Form (3NF).


### Database Schema
The final schema consists of several interconnected tables to manage the entire workflow of the food ordering process.

**Key Tables:**
* **`student`**: Stores student details, including contact information and credentials for logging in.
* **`stall`**: Contains information about each food stall, such as name, opening times, and minimum order amount.
* **`menu`**: Lists all food items available from each stall, along with their prices.
* **`delivery_boy`**: Manages information about the delivery personnel.
* **`orders`**: The central table that records all order details, linking the student, stall, and delivery boy.
* **`ordered_items`**: A junction table that lists the specific items and quantities for each order.
* **`order_status`**: Tracks the real-time status of an order (e.g., 'ACCEPTED', 'PICKED', 'DELIVERED', 'RETURNED').
* **`payment`**: Handles payment information, including transaction IDs and payment methods.

## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To demonstrate the practical application of the database, several key business queries were developed to track performance and derive insights.

**Sample KPI Queries:**
1.  **Stall-wise Revenue**: Calculates the total revenue generated by each food stall over a specific period, helping to identify the most popular stalls.
2.  **RTO (Return to Origin) Rate**: Measures the percentage of orders that are returned. This is a critical metric for monitoring delivery issues and customer dissatisfaction.
3.  **Average Delivery Time**: Computes the average time taken from order acceptance to final delivery, helping to assess the efficiency of the delivery process.
4.  **Most Demanded Food Items**: Identifies the best-selling food items across all stalls.
5.  **Peak Ordering Hours**: Determines the times of day with the highest order volume, allowing stalls to manage staffing and inventory more effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage

To set up and use this database, you can use the provided SQL script.

1.  **Create the Database**:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE foodstreetdb;
    USE foodstreetdb;
    ```
2.  **Build the Schema**:
    * Execute the table creation statements in the `foodstreetdb.txt` file. This will create all the required tables (`student`, `stall`, `orders`, etc.) with their respective columns, primary keys, and foreign key relationships.
3.  **Populate with Data**:
    * Run the `INSERT INTO` statements from the script to populate the database with sample data.
4.  **Run KPI Queries**:
    * Execute the KPI queries provided in the project files to analyze the sample data and generate business insights.
